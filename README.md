ðŸ§  Code Practice & Projects â€“ Python & JavaScript

This repository includes my daily coding practice, problem-solving exercises, and mini-projects built using "Python", "JavaScript", "Flask", and "Djando". I'm focused on strengthening my programming logic and building real-world skills by creating small but meaningful projects.


ðŸš€ Goals
- Practice coding regularly
- Build and improve programming logic
- Work on JavaScript and Python-based projects
- Keep track of progress in an organized way
